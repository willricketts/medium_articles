#Why isn’t there a holiday to celebrate open source software?
I really don’t understand why there isn’t some sort of international, or hell, even a national holiday to celebrate open source software and its collaborators. An immeasurable amount of the technology we take for granted every day was made possible by people’s willingness to work without pay and to forego potentially large paydays to push the software world forward by giving their code away for free, or at the least, dedicate their time to contribute to someone’s project.

Let’s look at the [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) project. The main repo itself is more than a decade old, is comprised of over 56,000 commits made by 3,000 contributors from all over the planet, and has powered the products of companies like [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Bloomberg](http://bloomberg.com), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), and [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com). Say what you will about the problems of Rails, but that’s quite an impressive résumé.

Holidays are weird. Some are seemingly pointless, yet still celebrated. Wikipedia describes Boxing Day as the following:

> Boxing Day is a holiday traditionally celebrated the weekday or Saturday following Christmas Day, when servants and tradesmen would receive gifts, known as a “Christmas box”, from their masters, employers or customers,[1] in the United Kingdom, The Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Bermuda, New Zealand, Kenya, South Africa, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and other former British colonies. Today, Boxing Day is the bank holiday or public holiday that generally takes place on 26 or 27 December.

I guess it’s cool for customers to honor merchants they favor once per year. It’s a nice idea, but open source software has been undeniably more impactful than customers honoring their merchants with gifts has ever been.

There really should be an open source holiday.
