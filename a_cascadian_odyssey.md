A Cascadian Odyssey Original Post Date: Jun 14th, 2015 — willricketts.com For the last few months, the fact that I haven’t taken a real vacation in years has been weighing on me. It’s interesting how one can get so caught up in work and projects — so much so that nearly a decade slips by without a trip to some far-away place. Because of this, I decided to book a flight to Seattle to ultimately join my good friends Ian and Ryan in Bellingham, Washington. The trip was utterly incredible. From the short layover in Phoenix on the way to Seattle in which I got to climb rocks in the desert, to the return flight from Seattle to a connection in Chicago during which I was able to fly over and photograph the Grand Tetons, every aspect of the trip was flooring.

Atlanta The trip began in my ~current city~ (I’m not really a fan of Atlanta, so I refuse to call it my home town) of Atlanta. Not being a fan of flying on airliners, I was concerned about the weather, which had been predicted to be quite stormy that day. As if by some divine providence, the clouds opened up just in time for my flight, which yielded outstanding visibility over the rapidly changing terrain as the flight progressed westward.

Phoenix As the flight drew closer to Phoenix, the landscape beneath us began to change dramatically. Lush forests and woodlands gave way to arid desert, riddled with Saguaro cacti. On our final approach, I noticed a multitude of gorgeous boulders and rock formations which looked ripe for climbing on my 4-hour layover. Never having been to Phoenix, or that far west in the country, I landed and immediately got an Uber driver to take me to one of the boulders visible from the plane, which was Papago Park. Papago is a state park on the edge of Phoenix filled with some incredible rock formations. It’s a gorgeous area which is quintessentially Arizonan.

Satisfied with my brief chance to do some climbing in the desert and to see some cacti, I got another Uber driver back to the airport to get ready for the flight into Seattle, but not before stopping for lunch at a taco join which was touted as the “best tacos in Phoenix.” Recommended to me by a local, the place didn’t have a name, a sign, windows, or even an “open” sign.







Seattle I touched down in Seattle, and was met by my old friend Ian, and his friend Christine, who had come to Washington to meet up with a friend to take a bike trip from Bellingham to San Francisco. We promptly hit the road to head up to Bellingham, but not so quickly that I couldn’t snap a few shots of the Seattle skyline.







Bellingham It was pretty dark when we finally arrived in Bellingham, so I wasn’t totally able to see a whole lot until the morning, but after a night of drinks on the porch and sleeping like a rock, morning broke to reveal the immense beauty that it Bellingham, Washington.

The entire area is incredibly lush with fern ground cover, and is shaded by beautiful, towering Douglas Firs. The city itself reminds me of my hometown, Pensacola; especially the downtown area. It’s a somewhat quiet town about 90 minutes north of Seattle, and an hour south of Vancouver, BC.







We awoke the next day, and headed into Fairhaven for breakfast. On the way, we made a stop so that I could touch the Pacific ocean for the first time. Come on… I’m not ~not~ going to do it.







Upon arriving at our breakfast spot, I immediately decided that it would only be appropriate to consume copious amounts of Salmon while in the Pacific Northwest, so I ordered up some incredible Salmon Eggs Benedict with roasted red potatoes. I really couldn’t have asked for a more fitting breakfast with which to start a day of exploring mountains and hiking all over the hidden gems of Bellingham.

As a sidenote, Ian’s friend Christine was picking up her bike from a local bike shop for the ride to San Francisco, so Ian and I took the opportunity to take a walk down a pier in Fairhaven. The air was cold, and the sky was gray. It was exactly how I had pictured it. It was perfect.

After breakfast, we headed up to a stunning waterfall in Bellingham. This place was simply flooring. Living in Atlanta, I make frequent trips up to Foster Falls in Jasper, TN to get a glimpse at its 80-foot falls, which have always been incredible to me, and worth the drive in itself. Here in Bellingham, these falls were readily accessible and placed right inside of town as if it was some deliberately placed retreat. After taking the obligatory pictures with friends, and admiring the falls for a bit, we proceeded on with our agenda.







Mt. Baker Upon leaving the waterfall, we all packed up into the car and headed toward Mt. Baker, which I’ve been dying to see ever since Ian started texting me pictures of its snowy cols and glaciated faces. After about 45 minutes on the road, the terrain started to get pretty vertical. The tunnels of towering firs became expansive vistas of alpine splendor.

After a long drive up into the mountains, and after a series of treacherous-looking switchbacks padded with 5-foot layers of ice, we reached the highest driveable point in the park. What else would we do but get out and run around in the snow?







After coming down from Mt Baker, we headed into downtown Bellingham to meet up with Christine’s touring partner, Jayde, after which we all went to a restaurant in the downtown area for some salmon, where we watched middle-aged cascadians dance around in conga lines, reinforcing our already steadfast belief that middle age looks bleak.







Christine and Jayde Depart for San Francisco The next day, we woke up and made an amazing breakfast for our Christine and Jayde, who were leaving that day for San Francisco. After watching them pack up their stuff, don their peculiar biking ass-protector shorts, and cram things into their saddlebags, they departed in a somewhat cinematic way.

…and Jayde immediately fell over into the grass.

After watching them disappear into the distance, Ryan, Ian, and I packed up for an adventure to the Canadian Border.

Canadian Border We packed up the car and headed north toward the border. Once we arrived, we went to check out the border itself before heading over to the Peace Arch, which is a large monument to the friendship shared by the USA and Canada. If you’ve never seen the border between the two countries in Blaine, Washington, know that it’s simply a small strip of grass. Being that a neighborhood was just on the other side, a Canadian guy was biking down the road. I immedately and reflexively yelled, “SHIT! Look, a Canadian!” Realizing that I’m just a dumb and uncultured American, he smiled and waved, likely thinking, “what an idiot.”







Once we reached the Peace Arch on the border, I went to ask a Border Patrol agent if it would be ok for me to put one foot into Canada for a picture. I don’t know about you, but standing on an international border makes me a little bit nervous when there are dudes everywhre walking around with guns and seemingly foul dispositions. We got the OK, and shot a few pictures. It was then that Ryan noticed that the Border Patrol agent’s name was John Snow. Funny enough, he guards the northern-most border of the country. If you’re a Game of Thrones fan, you’ll get the reference. If not, see here.







After leaving the border, we took a slow drive through Blaine, Washington, which was my first time actually getting a chance to examine what a border town is like. I’ve always been interested by border towns, as they generally have a sole reason for existence. It’s not their merit, their scenery, nightlife, industry, opportunity, or culture. It’s simply because they’re on the border. As a result, they tend to be inhabited by some really peculiar people. Washington border towns seem to fit this generalization quite well. We drove through town and passed a multitude of bars, all of which had front patios with lone bearded old men in flannel shirts angrily smoking cigarettes and drinking beer at 10:30am.

Cascade Loop The next day, we woke up with the sole intent of heading out into the Cascades. We had breakfast, packed the car, and headed toward the park. Along the way, we stopped in an interesting little town called Concrete, WA where we picked up some Deadman’s Reach coffee. Of course, I had to grab a photo with the giant silo that was adorned with one of the greatest typefaces I’ve ever seen.







After leaving Concrete, we headed into North Cascades National Park, where I was simply blown away by the seemingly endless expanse of snowy peaks. This was exactly what I’d been pining over on Google Images for so long. I’d finally arrived, and as quickly as the natural beauty of the North Cascades had crept into my vision, I hurt my ankle, and was unable to walk.

Just after entering the park, we decided to hop out of the car and go for a stroll. We went to cross a road, and I hopped over a highway guard rail onto a slanted surface and sprained my ankle. What luck…

After a hobble back to the car, we quickly decided that I was going to be unable to hike through the Cacades as we had planned. It was at this point I realized just how lucky I am to have sharp and quick-witted friends. Ian and Ryan came to the conclusion that this exploration would have to be done by car, and that none of us had ever done the entire 14-hour Cascade Loop. That was all we needed. Off we went, barrelling through the mountains toward the high alpine desert.







With the roadtrip tunes cranked to eleven (here’s looking at you, Gucci Mane, we passed Liberty Bell (above), which I immediately declared the holy quest of my climbing endeavors, vowing to one day climb it. After an hour or so, we continued to wade through a sea of snowy peaks.







And more snowy peaks…

As we drew closer to the alpine desert, the landscape became increasingly arid, and its hues lost their snowy veneer in favor of colors of rust and sand.







After a few hours of driving, we emerged into the high alpine desert of East Washington. The air had an unforgettably piercing dryness to it. Once we emerged fully into the desert, we picked an area to pull off, and had lunch in a field of natural sage brushes. We picked a stem of sage, and stuck it into the A/C vent of the car. I’ll never forget the strong scent of freshly picked sage in the car as we made our way back to Bellingham.







Back to Bellingham After arriving back in Bellingham from our incredible road trip through Washington, we stopped near Sudden Valley to take in the sunset and figured out how we would spend my last evening in the Pacific Northwest. Of course Ryan had some sort of illegal Mexican fireworks at home, as well as a home-welded launcher of sorts.







Once night fell, we loaded up into Ian’s car, and drove to the side of Lake Whatcom opposite to Ian’s house and began to prepare for the fireworks show.

We pulled off to the side of the road, and Ryan prepared the launcher and its payload. Once it was set, he lit the fuse, and we all hid behind Ian’s car. When Ryan turned to run toward Ian’s car, he knocked the launcher over, which quickly turned to face toward us. Its payload launched, and boomed with an enormous explosion a mere 30 feet from us. Realizing this would inevitably draw the attention of Bellingham’s finest, we piled back into the car and headed back to Ian’s house for drinks and celebration of a great trip.

Back to Seattle In the morning, it was time to head back to Seattle to catch my flight home. Ian and I loaded up into the car, and headed into the city to catch a few sights.

Of course, we had to see the famous Pike Place Market, as well as have a lunch of crab at the Athenian.







Lunch came with quiet the view of the Puget sound. It was great to finally be able to watch the ferryboats come in and out of the city, and to see the Seattle skyline.







Afterward, we headed down to Ghost Alley Espresso for some coffee before heading to SEATAC.







Back to Atlanta Since I had first thought of visting the Pacific Northwest, I’d dreameded of climbing Mt. Rainier. Sadly, through the entire trip, I hadn’t been able to catch a glimpse of it. I missed it on the flight in, and its view was obscured by clouds on both the drive from Seattle to Bellingham, and on the return, so once Ian dropped me off at the airport, I immediately raced toward the southernmost window of SEATAC in the hopes that I might be able to see it. Sadly, it was again hidden by clouds.

I boarded my flight, and as soon as we punched through the clouds, there it was. Talk about closure.







And as an added bonus, I got a shot of the entire Grand Tetons range from 38,000 ft.







Finally Home I arrived back in Atlanta in a daze. Was it the amazing experience I just had? Was it the lingering effects of the “medication” of Washington State? I’m not entirely sure, but I do know that it was the most impactful trip I’ve ever taken, that I left a piece of myself up there, and I’m dying to visit again to find it.)
